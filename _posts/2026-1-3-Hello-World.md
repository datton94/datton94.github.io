title: Hello World, This Is My DevOps Learning Log
---

# Introduction

Hi, I am **Dat**. I am a DevOps Engineer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

This blog is my public notebook. My goal is simple: I want to keep learning, grow my career, and share my knowledge with people all over the world.

## Why I started this blog

The DevOps world moves very fast. New tools appear, old tools change, and cloud services get updates every day.

I realized that if I only learn in my head, I will eventually forget. But if I write it down, I remember better. And if I share it here, maybe it can help you too.

This blog will be practical and honest. When I make mistakes, I will share them. When I find a better solution, I will update my notes.

## Who I am

I have over **7 years of experience** working with cloud and infrastructure. My main focus is on:

* **Cloud:** AWS and Microsoft Azure
* **Kubernetes:** EKS, AKS, Rancher RKE2
* **IaC:** Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
* **Observability:** VictoriaMetrics, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki
* **CI/CD & GitOps:** Argo CD, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
* **Scripting:** Bash, Python, Go

In the past, I helped teams migrate platforms, manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, improve monitoring, and optimize cloud costs. Recently, I have also been experimenting with **AI-driven automation** to help with cluster operations.

## What you will find here

I plan to write about real-world scenarios, such as:

* Designing Kubernetes platforms for production workloads.
* Performing safe cluster upgrades with zero downtime.
* Building scalable monitoring systems (metrics, logs, alerts).
* Writing clean and safe Terraform modules.
* Creating fast, easy-to-debug CI/CD pipelines.
* Controlling cloud costs without reducing performance.
* Simple scripts and tools that save time.
* Experiments with AI agents for Ops: what works and what fails.

## A note on my writing

English is not my first language, so I will use simple words. My priority is **clarity**, not fancy writing.

If you spot any mistakes, please let me know. I am always happy to fix them and learn.

## Let's connect

If you work in DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering, or Cloud, I would love to connect with you.

Thanks for reading. My next post will be a practical guide something you can use at work immediately, not just theory.
