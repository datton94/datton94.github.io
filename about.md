Hard-working and adaptable DevOps/Platform Engineer with hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and automation. Eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve skills to deliver reliable, scalable solutions.

### More Information

I started my career in IT support and system administration, taking care of networks, servers, and firewalls. That gave me a good foundation in how systems work.

Later, I moved into DevOps, where I worked with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. I built CI/CD pipelines, migrated applications into containers, and improved monitoring so teams could solve problems faster. At NashTech, I got the chance to lead big migrations on AWS EKS and set up GitOps with ArgoCD.

Now, Iâ€™m a Senior Platform Engineer, managing EKS and Rancher clusters, automating security patching, and building centralized monitoring with Grafana and VictoriaMetrics. I also enjoy mentoring others, like training new engineers on Terraform.

I have 8 years of experience in total for my IT career, with 6 years as a DevOps/Platform engineer, and I want to continue enjoying this journey for the next 15 years. For me, the best part of DevOps is solving problems and learning new tools. I like challenges and always want to make systems more reliable and scalable.
